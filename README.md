# RuneBot-OCR

What does the TriviaEvent do?

1. Takes a screenshot of the screen, uses an OCR API and converts the screenshot to text.
2. Executes commands such as /daily (every 6 hours) and answers these questions automatically.
3. Extracts words from the OCR text and compares to a dumped list of questions & answers.
4. Compares the two questions together and the one that matches the most, that answer will be picked.
5. Completed. Runs again every 6 hours.
